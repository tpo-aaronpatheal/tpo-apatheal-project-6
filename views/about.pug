          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I am currently a software engineer that is seeking a position within Travelers Insurance Technology. What's better than a technically skilled software developer? A technically skilled software developer with an extensive background in the insurance industry and vast knowledge of the inner workings of an insurance company. Now I know what you are thinking. This is just too good to be true, but I can assure you that it isn't. My business accumen even rivals my amazing software development skills. The best software engineer is always the one that truly understands who their customer is and the purpose of their design. Tell you what, if you hire me I'll even pinch you to prove that you aren't dreaming. Your move.
